Grew up in Northern Wisconsin and finished my lower education in South Texas finding my love for<br>
programming in robotics. Joined the Uvalde HS Robotics team as the lead programmer and competed in<br>
the group's first BEST Robotics competition. Academic competitor in Texas UIL finding my best finish<br>
in the Computer Science competition at super regionals in San Antonio Texas. From these high school<br>
competitions I became self-taught to code in C and Java.<br>
<br>
Received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Gonzaga University in lovely<br>
Spokane Washington. The topics of my coursework have been in Data Science, Algorithms, Database<br>
Systems & Management, Mobile Application Development, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence, <br>
Software Development, and Embedded Systems<br>
<br>
I have working experience in Data Management during the 2023 Summer, in the experience I worked<br>
with the Julien's/Mi Vida team to develop, organize, the storage, and the analyzation of data within<br>
their system. I was also responsible for identifying the queries needed from software solution architects<br>
to help integrate their database with new software for the company.<br>
<br>
Currently I work as a Software Engineer, in which I am responsible for programming full-stack<br>
applications for InfoTech NorthStar LLC. I am also pursuing my Master's in Embedded Systems<br>
at Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden. Which I hope to transition from standard software<br>
engineering to embedded systems<br>
